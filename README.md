A simple nodejs player for WebAssembly Music
============================================

During the presentation by [Otto Rottier](https://github.com/orottier) at WAC 2025, I made this little demo to test the [node-web-audio-api](https://github.com/ircam-ismm/node-web-audio-api) with WebAssembly files that produce full music tracks.

The [node-web-audio-api](https://github.com/ircam-ismm/node-web-audio-api) implements the same `AudioWorkletNode` interface as you can find in the browser. The [WebAssembly Music](https://github.com/petersalomonsen/javascriptmusic) project leverage that to pull sample data generated by a WebAssembly module and play it in real time ( or export to a file using `OfflineAudioContext` ).

In this demonstration the sample data produced by the Webassembly Music module will be rendered in real time.

## How to use

Install dependencies first

```
npm install
```

Play the wasm-music file [noiseandmadness.wasm](./noiseandmadness.wasm):

```bash
node play.js noiseandmadness.wasm
```

or

```bash
node play.js themonsterisclose.wasm
```

# How this aligns with my presentation at WAC 2025

At WAC 2025 I will present `WebAssembly Music Instrument plugin NFTs`, which is all about distributing WebAssembly files as plugins. Being able to play content from a Wasm music file in nodejs, is another great showcase of this portability.

We will take Wasm files that are created and exported from the WebAssembly Music live coding app, which you can find here:

In addition to playing it in nodejs, we will also load it into the Reaper DAW ( remember to export as `Wasm library module` from the Wasm Music app ). The Reaper DAW must have this plugin installed for hosting WebAssembly Music plugins:

But then what about private distribution of content, and also if you want to sell and license it and ensure that the recipient has access to unique sounds. This is what my presentation is about, which you can find here.
